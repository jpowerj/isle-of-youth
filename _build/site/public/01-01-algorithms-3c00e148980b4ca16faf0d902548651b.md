# 1.1 Algorithms

Informally, an algorithm is any well-deûned computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output in a ûnite amount of time. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational
steps that transform the input into the output.
You can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciûed computational
problem. The statement of the problem speciûes in general terms the desired
input/output relationship for problem instances, typically of arbitrarily large size.
The algorithm describes a speciûc computational procedure for achieving that input/
output relationship for all problem instances.
As an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into monotonically
increasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides
fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools.
Here is how we formally deûne the sorting problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i.
Output: A permutation (reordering) ha 0
1 ; a 0
2 ; : : : ; a 0
n i of the input sequence such
that a 0
1 හ a 0
2 හ    හ a 0
n .
Thus, given the input sequence h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i, a correct sorting algorithm
returns as output the sequence h26; 31; 41; 41; 58; 59i. Such an input sequence is
6 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing
called an instance of the sorting problem. In general, an instance of a problem 1
consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem
statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.
Because many programs use it as an intermediate step, sorting is a fundamental
operation in computer science. As a result, you have a large number of good sorting
algorithms at your disposal. Which algorithm is best for a given application
depends on4among other factors4the number of items to be sorted, the extent
to which the items are already somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item
values, the architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used:
main memory, disks, or even4archaically4tapes.
An algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem instance
provided as input, it halts4ûnishes its computing in ûnite time4and outputs
the correct solution to the problem instance. A correct algorithm solves the
given computational problem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some
input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer. Contrary to what you
might expect, incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if you can control
their error rate. We’ll see an example of an algorithm with a controllable error rate
in Chapter 31 when we study algorithms for ûnding large prime numbers. Ordinarily,
however, we’ll concern ourselves only with correct algorithms.
An algorithm can be speciûed in English, as a computer program, or even as
a hardware design. The only requirement is that the speciûcation must provide a
precise description of the computational procedure to be followed.

**What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?**

Sorting is by no means the only computational problem for which algorithms have
been developed. (You probably suspected as much when you saw the size of this
book.) Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous and include the following
examples:
 The Human Genome Project has made great progress toward the goals of identifying
all the roughly 30,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequences
of the roughly 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, storing
this information in databases, and developing tools for data analysis. Each
of these steps requires sophisticated algorithms. Although the solutions to the
various problems involved are beyond the scope of this book, many methods to
solve these biological problems use ideas presented here, enabling scientists to
accomplish tasks while using resources efûciently. Dynamic programming, as
1 Sometimes, when the problem context is known, problem instances are themselves simply called
"problems."


in Chapter 14, is an important technique for solving several of these biological
problems, particularly ones that involve determining similarity between DNA
sequences. The savings realized are in time, both human and machine, and in
money, as more information can be extracted by laboratory techniques.
 The internet enables people all around the world to quickly access and retrieve
large amounts of information. With the aid of clever algorithms, sites on the
internet are able to manage and manipulate this large volume of data. Examples
of problems that make essential use of algorithms include ûnding good
routes on which the data travels (techniques for solving such problems appear
in Chapter 22), and using a search engine to quickly ûnd pages on which particular
information resides (related techniques are in Chapters 11 and 32).
 Electronic commerce enables goods and services to be negotiated and exchanged
electronically, and it depends on the privacy of personal information
such as credit card numbers, passwords, and bank statements. The core
technologies used in electronic commerce include public-key cryptography and
digital signatures (covered in Chapter 31), which are based on numerical algorithms
and number theory.
 Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises often need to allocate scarce
resources in the most beneûcial way. An oil company might wish to know
where to place its wells in order to maximize its expected proût. A political
candidate might want to determine where to spend money buying campaign advertising
in order to maximize the chances of winning an election. An airline
might wish to assign crews to üights in the least expensive way possible, making
sure that each üight is covered and that government regulations regarding
crew scheduling are met. An internet service provider might wish to determine
where to place additional resources in order to serve its customers more effectively.
All of these are examples of problems that can be solved by modeling
them as linear programs, which Chapter 29 explores.
Although some of the details of these examples are beyond the scope of this
book, we do give underlying techniques that apply to these problems and problem
areas. We also show how to solve many speciûc problems, including the following:
 You have a road map on which the distance between each pair of adjacent intersections
is marked, and you wish to determine the shortest route from one
intersection to another. The number of possible routes can be huge, even if you
disallow routes that cross over themselves. How can you choose which of all
possible routes is the shortest? You can start by modeling the road map (which
is itself a model of the actual roads) as a graph (which we will meet in Part VI
and Appendix B). In this graph, you wish to ûnd the shortest path from one
vertex to another. Chapter 22 shows how to solve this problem efûciently.
8 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing
 Given a mechanical design in terms of a library of parts, where each part may
include instances of other parts, list the parts in order so that each part appears
before any part that uses it. If the design comprises n parts, then there are nŠ
possible orders, where nŠ denotes the factorial function. Because the factorial
function grows faster than even an exponential function, you cannot feasibly
generate each possible order and then verify that, within that order, each part
appears before the parts using it (unless you have only a few parts). This problem
is an instance of topological sorting, and Chapter 20 shows how to solve
this problem efûciently.
 A doctor needs to determine whether an image represents a cancerous tumor or
a benign one. The doctor has available images of many other tumors, some of
which are known to be cancerous and some of which are known to be benign.
A cancerous tumor is likely to be more similar to other cancerous tumors than
to benign tumors, and a benign tumor is more likely to be similar to other benign
tumors. By using a clustering algorithm, as in Chapter 33, the doctor can
identify which outcome is more likely.
 You need to compress a large ûle containing text so that it occupies less space.
Many ways to do so are known, including "LZW compression," which looks for repeating character sequences. Chapter 15 studies a different approach, "Huffman coding," which encodes characters by bit sequences of various lengths,
with characters occurring more frequently encoded by shorter bit sequences.
These lists are far from exhaustive (as you again have probably surmised from
this book’s heft), but they exhibit two characteristics common to many interesting
algorithmic problems:
1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do
not solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is "best," without explicitly examining each possible solution, can present quite a challenge.

2. They have practical applications. Of the problems in the above list, ûnding the
shortest path provides the easiest examples. A transportation ûrm, such as a
trucking or railroad company, has a ûnancial interest in ûnding shortest paths
through a road or rail network because taking shorter paths results in lower
labor and fuel costs. Or a routing node on the internet might need to ûnd the
shortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly. Or a
person wishing to drive from New York to Boston might want to ûnd driving
directions using a navigation app.
Not every problem solved by algorithms has an easily identiûed set of candidate
solutions. For example, given a set of numerical values representing samples
of a signal taken at regular time intervals, the discrete Fourier transform converts
1.1 Algorithms 9
the time domain to the frequency domain. That is, it approximates the signal as a
weighted sum of sinusoids, producing the strength of various frequencies which,
when summed, approximate the sampled signal. In addition to lying at the heart of
signal processing, discrete Fourier transforms have applications in data compression
and multiplying large polynomials and integers. Chapter 30 gives an efûcient
algorithm, the fast Fourier transform (commonly called the FFT), for this problem.
The chapter also sketches out the design of a hardware FFT circuit.

### Data structures

This book also presents several data structures. A data structure is a way to store
and organize data in order to facilitate access and modiûcations. Using the appropriate
data structure or structures is an important part of algorithm design. No single
data structure works well for all purposes, and so you should know the strengths
and limitations of several of them.

### Technique

Although you can use this book as a "cookbook" for algorithms, you might someday encounter a problem for which you cannot readily find a published algorithm
(many of the exercises and problems in this book, for example). This book will
teach you techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop algorithms
on your own, show that they give the correct answer, and analyze their efûciency.
Different chapters address different aspects of algorithmic problem solving.
Some chapters address speciûc problems, such as ûnding medians and order
statistics in Chapter 9, computing minimum spanning trees in Chapter 21, and determining
a maximum floow in a network in Chapter 24. Other chapters introduce techniques, such as divide-and-conquer in Chapters 2 and 4, dynamic programming
in Chapter 14, and amortized analysis in Chapter 16.

### Hard problems

Most of this book is about efficient algorithms. Our usual measure of efficiency is speed: how long does an algorithm take to produce its result? There are some
problems, however, for which we know of no algorithm that runs in a reasonable
amount of time. Chapter 34 studies an interesting subset of these problems, which
are known as NP-complete.
Why are NP-complete problems interesting? First, although no efûcient algorithm
for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven
that an efûcient algorithm for one cannot exist. In other words, no one knows
whether efûcient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems. Second, the set of
10 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing
NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efûcient algorithm
exists for any one of them, then efûcient algorithms exist for all of them. This relationship
among the NP-complete problems makes the lack of efûcient solutions
all the more tantalizing. Third, several NP-complete problems are similar, but not
identical, to problems for which we do know of efûcient algorithms. Computer
scientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause
a big change to the efûciency of the best known algorithm.
You should know about NP-complete problems because some of them arise surprisingly
often in real applications. If you are called upon to produce an efûcient
algorithm for an NP-complete problem, you are likely to spend a lot of time in a
fruitless search. If, instead, you can show that the problem is NP-complete, you
can spend your time developing an efûcient approximation algorithm, that is, an
algorithm that gives a good, but not necessarily the best possible, solution.
As a concrete example, consider a delivery company with a central depot. Each
day, it loads up delivery trucks at the depot and sends them around to deliver goods to several addresses. At the end of the day, each truck must end up back at the depot
so that it is ready to be loaded for the next day. To reduce costs, the company wants
to select an order of delivery stops that yields the lowest overall distance traveled by
each truck. This problem is the well-known "traveling-salesperson problem," and it is NP-complete. 2 It has no known efûcient algorithm. Under certain assumptions,
however, we know of efûcient algorithms that compute overall distances close to
the smallest possible. Chapter 35 discusses such "approximation algorithms."

### Alternative computing models

For many years, we could count on processor clock speeds increasing at a steady
rate. Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever-increasing clock
speeds, however: because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed,
chips run the risk of melting once their clock speeds become high enough. In order
to perform more computations per second, therefore, chips are being designed
to contain not just one but several processing "cores." We can liken these multicore
computers to several sequential computers on a single chip. In other words,
they are a type of <parallel computer.= In order to elicit the best performance
from multicore computers, we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind.
Chapter 26 presents a model for =task-parallel= algorithms, which take advantage
of multiple processing cores. This model has advantages from both theoretical and
2 To be precise, only decision problems -- those with a "yes/no" answer -- can be NP-complete. The decision version of the traveling salesperson problem asks whether there exists an order of stops whose distance totals at most a given amount.


practical standpoints, and many modern parallel-programming platforms embrace
something similar to this model of parallelism.
Most of the examples in this book assume that all of the input data are available
when an algorithm begins running. Much of the work in algorithm design makes
the same assumption. For many important real-world examples, however, the input
actually arrives over time, and the algorithm must decide how to proceed without
knowing what data will arrive in the future. In a data center, jobs are constantly
arriving and departing, and a scheduling algorithm must decide when and where to
run a job, without knowing what jobs will be arriving in the future. Trafûc must
be routed in the internet based on the current state, without knowing about where
trafûc will arrive in the future. Hospital emergency rooms make triage decisions
about which patients to treat ûrst without knowing when other patients will be
arriving in the future and what treatments they will need. Algorithms that receive
their input over time, rather than having all the input present at the start, are online
algorithms, which Chapter 27 examines.
